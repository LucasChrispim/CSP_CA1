            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p id="1">
                <strong>British Columbia</strong> (BC; French: <em>Colombie-Britannique</em>) is the westernmost
                province of Canada. Situated between the Pacific Ocean and the continental divide of the Rocky
                Mountains, the province has a diverse geography, replete with rugged landscapes that include rocky
                coastlines, sandy beaches, forests, lakes, mountains, inland deserts and grassy plains.<sup>[6]</sup> It
                borders the Canadian province of Alberta to the east and the Canadian territory of Yukon to the north.
                With an estimated population of 5.2 million as of 2021, it is Canada's third-most populous province. The
                capital of British Columbia is Victoria and its largest city is Vancouver. Vancouver is the
                third-largest metropolitan area in Canada; the 2021 census recorded 2,642,825 people in Metro
                Vancouver.<sup>[7]</sup> The majority of the population resides in the Lower Mainland, Vancouver Island,
                and Okanagan regions.<sup>[8]</sup>

                First Nations, the first inhabitants of the land, have a history of at least 10,000 years in the area.
                Such groups include the Coast Salish, Tsilhqotʼin, and Haida peoples, among many others. One of the
                earliest British settlements in the area was Fort Victoria, established in 1843, which gave rise to the
                city of Victoria, the first capital of the Colony of Vancouver Island. The Colony of British Columbia
                (1858–1866) was subsequently founded on the mainland by Richard Clement Moody<sup>[9]</sup> and the
                Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment in response to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. Although Governor James
                Douglas selected Fort Langley as the provisional capital of the fledgling colony, Moody established a
                new capital north of the Fraser River the following year, named New Westminster by Queen Victoria. In
                1866, the colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia unified, inheriting the mainland colony's
                name and Victoria as the united colony's capital. In 1871, British Columbia entered Confederation as the
                sixth province of Canada via the British Columbia Terms of Union.

                British Columbia is a diverse and cosmopolitan province, drawing on a plethora of cultural influences
                from its British, European, and Asian diasporas, as well as the local Indigenous population. Though the
                province's ethnic majority originates from the British Isles, many British Columbians also trace their
                roots back to continental Europe, China, and South Asia.<sup>[10]</sup> Indigenous Canadians make up
                about 5 percent of the province's total population. Christianity is the most subscribed religion,
                although the amount of British Columbians who claim no religious affiliation whatsoever is high by
                Canadian standards.<sup>[11]</sup> English is the common language of the province, although Punjabi,
                Mandarin Chinese, and Cantonese also have a large presence in the Metro Vancouver region. The
                Franco-Columbian community is an officially recognized linguistic minority, and around 72,000 British
                Columbians claim French as their mother tongue.<sup>[12]</sup> British Columbia is home to at least 34
                distinct Indigenous languages.<sup>[13]</sup>

                British Columbia's economy is primarily based on forestry, mining, cinematography and filmmaking,
                tourism, real estate, construction, wholesale and retail. Its main exports include lumber and timber,
                pulp and paper products, copper, coal, and natural gas.<sup>[14]</sup> British Columbia also benefits
                from high property values and being a centre for maritime trade:<sup>[15]</sup> the Port of Vancouver is
                the largest port in Canada and the most diversified port in North America.<sup>[16]</sup> Although less
                than 5 percent of the province's territory is arable land, significant agriculture exists in the Fraser
                Valley and Okanagan thanks to the warmer climate.<sup>[17]</sup> British Columbia is the fourth-largest
                province or territory by GDP.<sup>[18]</sup>
            </p>
            <h1>Etymology</h1>
            <p id="2">
                The province's name was chosen by Queen Victoria, when the Colony of British Columbia (1858–1866), i.e.,
                <strong>"the Mainland"</strong>, became a British colony in 1858.<sup>[19]</sup> It refers to the
                Columbia District, the British name for the territory drained by the Columbia River, in southeastern
                British Columbia, which was the namesake of the pre-Oregon Treaty Columbia Department of the Hudson's
                Bay Company. Queen Victoria chose British Columbia to distinguish what was the British sector of the
                Columbia District from the United States ("American Columbia" or "Southern Columbia"), which became the
                Oregon Territory on August 8, 1848, as a result of the treaty.<sup>[20]</sup>

                Ultimately, the Columbia in the name British Columbia is derived from the name of the Columbia Rediviva,
                an American ship which lent its name to the Columbia River and later the wider region;<sup>[21]</sup>
                the Columbia in the name Columbia Rediviva came from the name Columbia for the New World or parts
                thereof, a reference to Christopher Columbus.

            <p id="3">
                Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_British_Columbia"><em>Geography of
                        British Columbia</em></a>

                British Columbia is bordered to the west by the Pacific Ocean and the American state of Alaska, to the
                north by Yukon and the Northwest Territories, to the east by the province of Alberta, and to the south
                by the American states of Washington, Idaho, and Montana. The southern border of British Columbia was
                established by the 1846 Oregon Treaty, although its history is tied with lands as far south as
                California. British Columbia's land area is 944,735 square kilometres (364,800 sq mi). British
                Columbia's rugged coastline stretches for more than 27,000 kilometres (17,000 mi), and includes deep,
                mountainous fjords and about 6,000 islands, most of which are uninhabited. It is the only province in
                Canada that borders the Pacific Ocean.

                British Columbia's capital is Victoria, located at the southeastern tip of Vancouver Island. Only a
                narrow strip of Vancouver Island, from Campbell River to Victoria, is significantly populated. Much of
                the western part of Vancouver Island and the rest of the coast is covered by temperate rainforest.

                The province's most populous city is Vancouver, which is at the confluence of the Fraser River and
                Georgia Strait, in the mainland's southwest corner (an area often called the Lower Mainland). By land
                area, Abbotsford is the largest city. Vanderhoof is near the geographic centre of the
                province.<sup>[22]</sup>

            </figure>
            The Coast Mountains and the Inside Passage's many inlets provide some of British Columbia's renowned and
            spectacular scenery, which forms the backdrop and context for a growing outdoor adventure and ecotourism
            industry. 75 percent of the province is mountainous (more than 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) above sea level); 60
            percent is forested; and only about 5 percent is arable.

            The province's mainland away from the coastal regions is somewhat moderated by the Pacific Ocean. Terrain
            ranges from dry inland forests and semi-arid valleys, to the range and canyon districts of the Central and
            Southern Interior, to boreal forest and subarctic prairie in the Northern Interior. High mountain regions
            both north and south have subalpine flora<sup>[23]</sup> and subalpine climate.

            The Okanagan wine area, extending from Vernon to Osoyoos at the United States border, is one of several wine
            and cider-producing regions in Canada. Other wine regions in British Columbia include the Cowichan Valley on
            Vancouver Island and the Fraser Valley.

            The Southern Interior cities of Kamloops and Penticton have some of the warmest and longest summer climates
            in Canada (while higher elevations are cold and snowy), although their temperatures are often exceeded north
            of the Fraser Canyon, close to the confluence of the Fraser and Thompson rivers, where the terrain is rugged
            and covered with desert-type flora. Semi-desert grassland is found in large areas of the Interior Plateau,
            with land uses ranging from ranching at lower altitudes to forestry at higher ones.

            The northern, mostly mountainous, two-thirds of the province is largely unpopulated and undeveloped, except
            for the area east of the Rockies, where the Peace River Country contains BC's portion of the Canadian
            Prairies, centred at the city of Dawson Creek.

            British Columbia is considered part of the Pacific Northwest and the Cascadia bioregion, along with the
            American states of Alaska, Idaho, (western) Montana, Oregon, Washington, and (northern)
            California.<sup>[24][25]</sup>
            </p>
            <article class="Geography">
                <h2>Climate</h2>
                <p id="4">
                    Because of the many mountain ranges and rugged coastline, British Columbia's climate varies
                    dramatically across the province.

                    Coastal southern British Columbia has a mild, rainy oceanic climate, influenced by the North Pacific
                    Current, which has its origins in the Kuroshio Current. Hucuktlis Lake on Vancouver Island receives
                    an average of 6,903 mm (271.8 in) of rain annually, and some parts of the area are even classified
                    as warm-summer Mediterranean, the northernmost occurrence in the world. In Victoria, the annual
                    average temperature is 11.2 °C (52.2 °F), the warmest in Canada.

                    Due to the blocking presence of successive mountain ranges, the climate of some of the interior
                    valleys of the province is semi-arid with certain locations receiving less than 250 millimetres (10
                    in) in annual precipitation. The annual mean temperature in the most populated areas of the province
                    is up to 12 °C (54 °F), the mildest anywhere in Canada.

                    The valleys of the Southern Interior have short winters with only brief bouts of cold or infrequent
                    heavy snow, while those in the Cariboo, in the Central Interior, are colder because of increased
                    altitude and latitude, but without the intensity or duration experienced at similar latitudes
                    elsewhere in Canada. For example, the average daily low in Prince George (roughly in the middle of
                    the province) in January is −12 °C (10 °F).<sup>[26]</sup> Small towns in the southern interior with
                    high elevation such as Princeton are typically colder and snowier than cities in the
                    valleys.<sup>[27]</sup>

                    Heavy snowfall occurs in all elevated mountainous terrain providing bases for skiers in both south
                    and central British Columbia. Annual snowfall on highway mountain passes in the southern interior
                    rivals some of the snowiest cities in Canada,<sup>[28]</sup> and freezing rain and fog are sometimes
                    present on such roads as well.<sup>[29]</sup> This can result in hazardous driving conditions, as
                    people are usually travelling between warmer areas such as Vancouver or Kamloops, and may be unaware
                    that the conditions may be slippery and cold.<sup>[30]</sup>


                    Shuswap Lake as seen from Sorrento
                    Winters are generally severe in the Northern Interior, but even there, milder air can penetrate far
                    inland. The coldest temperature in British Columbia was recorded in Smith River, where it dropped to
                    −58.9 °C (−74.0 °F) on January 31, 1947,[31] one of the coldest readings recorded anywhere in North
                    America. Atlin in the province's far northwest, along with the adjoining Southern Lakes region of
                    Yukon, get midwinter thaws caused by the Chinook effect, which is also common (and much warmer) in
                    more southerly parts of the Interior.

                    During winter on the coast, rainfall, sometimes relentless heavy rain, dominates because of
                    consistent barrages of cyclonic low-pressure systems from the North Pacific. Average snowfall on the
                    coast during a normal winter is between 25 and 50 centimetres (10 and 20 in), but on occasion (and
                    not every winter) heavy snowfalls with more than 20 centimetres (8 in) and well below freezing
                    temperatures arrive when modified arctic air reaches coastal areas, typically for short periods, and
                    can take temperatures below −10 °C (14 °F), even at sea level. Arctic outflow winds can occasionally
                    result in wind chill temperatures at or even below −17.8 °C (0.0 °F).[citation needed]. While
                    winters are very wet, coastal areas are generally milder and dry during summer under the influence
                    of stable anti-cyclonic high pressure.

                    Southern Interior valleys are hot in summer; for example, in Osoyoos, the July maximum temperature
                    averages 31.7 °C (89.1 °F), making it the hottest month of any location in Canada; this hot weather
                    sometimes spreads towards the coast or to the far north of the province. Temperatures often exceed
                    40 °C (104 °F) in the lower elevations of valleys in the Interior during mid-summer, with the record
                    high of 49.6 °C (121.3 °F) being held in Lytton on June 30, 2021 during a record-breaking heat wave
                    that year.<sup>[32]</sup>


                    The Okanagan region has a climate suitable to vineyards.
                    The extended summer dryness often creates conditions that spark forest fires, from dry-lightning or
                    man-made causes. Many areas of the province are often covered by a blanket of heavy cloud and low
                    fog during the winter months, in contrast to abundant summer sunshine. Annual sunshine hours vary
                    from 2200 near Cranbrook and Victoria to less than 1300 in Prince Rupert, on the North Coast just
                    south of Southeast Alaska.

                    The exception to British Columbia's wet and cloudy winters is during the El Niño phase. During El
                    Niño events, the jet stream is much farther south across North America, making the province's
                    winters milder and drier than normal. Winters are much wetter and cooler during the opposite phase,
                    La Niña.

            The area now known as British Columbia is home to First Nations groups that have a deep history with a
            significant number of indigenous languages. There are more than 200 First Nations in BC. Prior to contact
            (with non-Aboriginal people), human history is known from oral histories of First Nations groups,
            archaeological investigations, and from early records from explorers encountering societies early in the
            period.

            The arrival of Paleoindians from Beringia took place between 20,000 and 12,000 years ago.<sup>[41]</sup>
            Hunter-gatherer families were the main social structure from 10,000 to 5,000 years ago.<sup>[42]</sup> The
            nomadic population lived in non-permanent structures foraging for nuts, berries and edible roots while
            hunting and trapping larger and small game for food and furs.<sup>[42]</sup> Around 5,000 years ago
            individual groups started to focus on resources available to them locally. Coast Salish peoples' had complex
            land management practices linked to ecosystem health and resilience. Forest gardens on Canada's northwest
            coast included crabapple, hazelnut, cranberry, wild plum, and wild cherry species.<sup>[43]</sup> Thus with
            the passage of time there is a pattern of increasing regional generalization with a more sedentary
            lifestyle.<sup>[42]</sup> These indigenous populations evolved over the next 5,000 years across a large area
            into many groups with shared traditions and customs.

            To the northwest of the province are the peoples of the Na-Dene languages, which include the
            Athapaskan-speaking peoples and the Tlingit, who lived on the islands of southern Alaska and northern
            British Columbia. The Na-Dene language group is believed to be linked to the Yeniseian languages of
            Siberia.<sup>[44]</sup> The Dene of the western Arctic may represent a distinct wave of migration from Asia
            to North America.<sup>[44]</sup> The Interior of British Columbia was home to the Salishan language groups
            such as the Shuswap (Secwepemc), Okanagan and Athabaskan language groups, primarily the Dakelh (Carrier) and
            the Tsilhqot'in.<sup>[45]</sup> The inlets and valleys of the British Columbia coast sheltered large,
            distinctive populations, such as the Haida, Kwakwaka'wakw and Nuu-chah-nulth, sustained by the region's
            abundant salmon and shellfish.<sup>[45]</sup> These peoples developed complex cultures dependent on the
            western red cedar that included wooden houses, seagoing whaling and war canoes and elaborately carved
            potlatch items and totem poles.<sup>[45]</sup>

            Contact with Europeans brought a series of devastating epidemics of diseases from Europe the people had no
            immunity to.[46] The result was a dramatic population collapse, culminating in the 1862 Smallpox outbreak in
            Victoria that spread throughout the coast. European settlement did not bode well for the remaining native
            population of British Columbia. Colonial officials deemed colonists could make better use of the land than
            the First Nations people, and thus the land territory be owned by the colonists.<sup>[47]</sup> To ensure
            colonists would be able to settle properly and make use of the land, First Nations were forcibly relocated
            onto reserves, which were often too small to support their way of life.<sup>[48]</sup> By the 1930s, British
            Columbia had over 1500 reserves.<sup>[49]</sup>

            The arrival of Europeans began around the mid-18th century, as fur traders entered the area to harvest sea
            otters. While it is thought <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Drake">Sir Francis Drake</a> may
            have explored the British Columbian coast in 1579, it was Juan Pérez who completed the first documented
            voyage, which took place in 1774. <a

                Quadra</a> explored the coast in 1775. In doing so, Pérez and Quadra reasserted the <a

            The explorations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook">James Cook</a> in 1778 and George
            Vancouver in 1792 and 1793 established British jurisdiction over the coastal area north and west of the
            Columbia River. In 1793, Sir Alexander Mackenzie was the first European to journey across North America
            overland to the Pacific Ocean, inscribing a stone marking his accomplishment on the shoreline of Dean
            Channel near Bella Coola. His expedition theoretically established British sovereignty inland, and a
            succession of other fur company explorers charted the maze of rivers and mountain ranges between the
            Canadian Prairies and the Pacific. Mackenzie and other explorers—notably John Finlay, Simon Fraser, Samuel
            Black, and David Thompson—were primarily concerned with extending the fur trade, rather than political
            considerations. In 1794, by the third of a series of agreements known as the Nootka Conventions, Spain
            conceded its claims of exclusivity in the Pacific. This opened the way for formal claims and colonization by
            other powers, including Britain, but because of the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, there was little British
            action on its claims in the region until later.

            The establishment of trading posts under the auspices of the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_Company">North West Company</a> and the Hudson's Bay
            Company (HBC), effectively established a permanent British presence in the region. The Columbia District was
            broadly defined as being south of 54°40 north latitude, (the southern limit of Russian America), north of
            Mexican-controlled California, and west of the Rocky Mountains. It was, by the Anglo-American Convention of
            1818, under the "joint occupancy and use" of citizens of the United States and subjects of Britain (which is
            to say, the fur companies). This co-occupancy was ended with the Oregon Treaty of 1846.

            The major supply route was the <a href="/wiki/York_Factory_Express" title="York Factory Express">York

            With the amalgamation of the two fur trading companies in 1821, modern-day British Columbia existed in three
            fur trading departments. The bulk of the central and northern interior was organized into the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia_(Canada)">New Caledonia</a> district, administered
            from Fort St. James. The interior south of the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_River">Thompson River</a> watershed and north of the
            Columbia was organized into the Columbia District, administered from Fort Vancouver on the lower Columbia
            River. The northeast corner of the province east of the Rockies, known as the Peace River Block, was
            attached to the much larger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Athabasca">Athabasca
                District</a>, headquartered in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Chipewyan,_Alberta">Fort
                Chipewyan</a>, in present-day Alberta.

            Until 1849, these districts were a wholly unorganized area of <a href="/wiki/British_North_America"

            territory was not a concession to the company. Rather, it was simply granted a monopoly to trade with the
            First Nations inhabitants. All that was changed with the westward extension of American exploration and the
            concomitant overlapping claims of territorial sovereignty, especially in the southern <a

            (within present day Washington and <a href="/wiki/Oregon" title="Oregon">Oregon</a>). In 1846, the <a

            this boundary (excluding Vancouver Island and the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_Islands" title="Gulf Islands">Gulf

                title="Colony of Vancouver Island">Colony of Vancouver Island</a> was created in 1849, with Victoria
            designated as the capital. New Caledonia, as the whole of the mainland rather than just its north-central

            "administered" by individual HBC trading post managers.

                        veterans was hardened by many of the available jobs being taken by European immigrants and
                        disgruntled veterans organized a range of "soldier parties" to represent their interests,

                        Much of Vancouver's prosperity and opulence in the 1920s results from this "pirate economy",
                        although growth in forestry, fishing and mining continued. By the end of the 1920s, the end of

                    There were some signs of economic life beginning to return to normal towards the end of the 1930s,

                        The pretext for continuing the coalition after the end of the Second World War was to prevent

                        post-war environment the government initiated a series of infrastructure projects, notably the

                        In 1947 the reins of the Coalition were taken by <a href="/wiki/Byron_Ingemar_Johnson"

                        referendum on electoral reform prior to this election had instigated an elimination ballot

                        third choices. The intent of the ballot, as campaigned for by Liberals and Conservatives, was
                        that their supporters would list the rival party in lieu of the CCF, but this plan backfired
                        when a large group of voters from all major parties, including the CCF, voted for the fringe
                        Social Credit Party, who wound up with the largest number of seats in the House (19), only one
                        seat ahead of the CCF, despite the CCF having 34.3 percent of the vote to Social Credit's 30.18
                        percent.

                        The Social Credit Party, led by rebel former Conservative MLA <a href="/wiki/W._A._C._Bennett"

                        <p id="16">
                            With the election of the Social Credit Party, British Columbia embarked on a phase of rapid <a href="/wiki/Economic_development" title="Economic development">economic development</a>. Bennett and his party governed the province for the next twenty years, during which time the government initiated an ambitious programme of infrastructure development, fuelled by a sustained economic boom in the forestry, mining, and energy sectors.
                            
                            During these two decades, the government <a href="/wiki/Nationalized" class="mw-redirect" title="Nationalized">nationalized</a> British Columbia Electric and the British Columbia Power Company, as well as smaller electric companies, renaming the entity <a href="/wiki/BC_Hydro" title="BC Hydro">BC Hydro</a>. <a href="/wiki/West_Kootenay_Power_and_Light" class="mw-redirect" title="West Kootenay Power and Light">West Kootenay Power and Light</a> remained independent of BC Hydro, being owned and operated by <a href="/wiki/Cominco" class="mw-redirect" title="Cominco">Cominco</a>, though tied into the regional power grid. By the end of the 1960s, several major dams had been begun or completed in—among others—the <a href="/wiki/Peace_River_(Canada)" class="mw-redirect" title="Peace River (Canada)">Peace</a>, Columbia, and <a href="/wiki/Nechako_River" title="Nechako River">Nechako River</a> watersheds (the Nechako Diversion to <a href="/wiki/Kemano" title="Kemano">Kemano</a>, was to supply power to the <a href="/wiki/Alcan_Inc." class="mw-redirect" title="Alcan Inc.">Alcan Inc.</a> aluminum smelter at <a href="/wiki/Kitimat" title="Kitimat">Kitimat</a>, and was not part of the provincial power grid but <a href="/wiki/Independent_Power_Producers_in_British_Columbia" class="mw-redirect" title="Independent Power Producers in British Columbia">privately owned</a>). Major transmission deals were concluded, most notably the <a href="/wiki/Columbia_River_Treaty" title="Columbia River Treaty">Columbia River Treaty</a> between Canada and the United States. The province's economy was also boosted by unprecedented growth in the forest sector, as well as oil and gas development in the province's northeast.

                            The 1950s and 1960s were also marked by development in the province's transportation infrastructure. In 1960, the government established <a href="/wiki/BC_Ferries" title="BC Ferries">BC Ferries</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Crown_corporations_of_Canada" title="Crown corporations of Canada">crown corporation</a>, to provide a marine extension of the provincial highway system, also supported by federal grants as being part of the <a href="/wiki/Trans-Canada_Highway" title="Trans-Canada Highway">Trans-Canada Highway</a> system. That system was improved and expanded through the construction of new highways and bridges, and paving of existing highways and provincial roads.
                            
                            Vancouver and Victoria became cultural centres as poets, authors, artists, musicians, as well as dancers, actors, and haute cuisine chefs flocked to its scenery and warmer temperatures, with the cultural and entrepreneurial community bolstered by many Draft dodgers from the United States. Tourism also played a role in the economy. The rise of Japan and other Pacific economies was a boost to British Columbia's economy, primarily because of exports of lumber products and unprocessed coal and trees

                            Politically and socially, the 1960s brought a period of significant social ferment. The divide between the political left and right, which had prevailed in the province since the Depression and the rise of the labour movement, sharpened as so-called free enterprise parties coalesced into the de facto coalition represented by Social Credit—in opposition to the social democratic New Democratic Party (NDP), the successor to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. As the province's economy blossomed, so did labour-management tensions. Tensions emerged, also, from the counterculture movement of the late 1960s, of which Vancouver and Nanaimo were centres. The conflict between hippies and Vancouver mayor Tom Campbell was particularly legendary, culminating in the Gastown riots of 1971. By the end of the decade, with social tensions and dissatisfaction with the status quo rising, the Bennett government's achievements could not stave off its growing unpopularity.

                         <h2>1970s and 1980s</h2>
                         <p id="17">
                            On August 27, 1969, the Social Credit Party was re-elected in a general election for what would be Bennett's final term in power. At the start of the 1970s, the economy was quite strong because of rising coal prices and an increase in annual allowable cuts in the forestry sector, but BC Hydro reported its first loss, which was the beginning of the end for Bennett and the Social Credit Party.[71]

                            The Socreds were forced from power in the August 1972 election, paving the way for a provincial NDP government under Dave Barrett. Under Barrett, the large provincial surplus soon became a deficit,[citation needed] although changes to the accounting system makes it likely some of the deficit was carried over from the previous Social Credit regime and its "two sets of books", as W. A. C. Bennett had once referred to his system of fiscal management. The brief three-year ("Thousand Days") period of NDP governance brought several lasting changes to the province, most notably the creation of the Agricultural Land Reserve, intended to protect farmland from redevelopment, and the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia, a crown corporation charged with a monopoly on providing single-payer basic automobile insurance.

                            Perceptions the government had instituted reforms either too swiftly or that were too far-reaching, coupled with growing labour disruptions led to the ouster of the NDP in the 1975 general election. Social Credit, under W.A.C. Bennett's son, Bill Bennett, was returned to office. Under the younger Bennett's government, 85 percent of the province's land base was transferred from Government Reserve to management by the Ministry of Forests, reporting of deputy ministers was centralized to the Premier's Office, and NDP-instigated social programs were rolled back, with then-human resources minister infamously demonstrating a golden shovel to highlight his welfare policy, although the new-era Social Credit Party also reinforced and backed certain others instigated by the NDP—notably the creation of the Resort Municipality of Whistler, whose special status including Sunday drinking, then an anomaly in BC.

                            Also during the "MiniWac" regime (a reference to his father's acronym, W. A. C.) certain money-losing Crown-owned assets were "privatized" in a mass giveaway of shares in the British Columbia Resources Investment Corporation, "BCRIC", with the "Brick shares" soon becoming near-worthless. Towards the end of his tenure in power, Bennett oversaw the completion of several megaprojects meant to stimulate the economy and win votes – unlike most right-wing parties, British Columbia's Social Credit actively practised government stimulation of the economy. Most notable of these was the winning of a world's fair for Vancouver, which came in the form of Expo 86, to which was tied the construction of the Coquihalla Highway and Vancouver's SkyTrain system. The Coquihalla Highway project became the subject of a scandal after revelations the premier's brother bought large tracts of land needed for the project before it was announced to the public, and also because of graft investigations of the huge cost overruns on the project. Both investigations were derailed in the media by a still further scandal, the Doman Scandal, in which the premier and millionaire backer Herb Doman were investigated for insider-trading and securities fraud. Nonetheless, the Socreds were re-elected in 1979 under Bennett, who led the party until 1986.

                            As the province entered a sustained recession, Bennett's popularity and media image were in decline. On April 1, 1983, Premier Bennett overstayed his constitutional limits of power by exceeding the legal tenure of a government, and the lieutenant governor, Henry Pybus Bell-Irving, was forced to call Bennett to Government House to resolve the impasse, and an election was called for April 30, while in the meantime government cheques were covered by special emergency warrants as the Executive Council no longer had signing authority because of the constitutional crisis. Campaigning on a platform of moderation, Bennett won an unexpected majority.

                            After several weeks of silence in the aftermath, a sitting of the House was finally called and in the speech from the throne, Social Credit instituted a programme of fiscal cutbacks dubbed "restraint", which had been a buzzword for moderation during the campaign. The programme included cuts to "motherhood" issues of the left, including the human rights branch, the offices of the Ombudsman and Rentalsman, women's programs, environmental and cultural programs, while still supplying mass capital infusions to corporate British Columbia. This sparked a backlash, with tens of thousands of people in the streets the next day after the budget speech, and through the course of a summer repeated large demonstrations of up to 100,000 people.

                            This became known as the 1983 Solidarity Crisis, from the name of the Solidarity Coalition, a huge grassroots opposition movement mobilized, consisting of organized labour and community groups, with the British Columbia Federation of Labour forming a separate organization of unions, Operation Solidarity, under the direction of Jack Munro, then-president of the International Woodworkers of America (IWA), the most powerful of the province's resource unions. Tens of thousands participated in protests and many felt a general strike would be the inevitable result unless the government backed down from its policies they had claimed were only about restraint and not about recrimination against the NDP and the left. Just as a strike at Pacific Press ended, which had crippled the political management of the public agenda by the publishers of the province's major papers, the movement collapsed after an apparent deal was struck by union leader and IWA president, Jack Munro and Premier Bennett.[72]

                            A tense winter of blockades at various job sites around the province ensued, as among the new laws were those enabling non-union labour to work on large projects and other sensitive labour issues, with companies from Alberta and other provinces brought in to compete with union-scale British Columbia companies. Despite the tension, Bennett's last few years in power were relatively peaceful as economic and political momentum grew on the megaprojects associated with Expo, and Bennett was to end his career by hosting Prince Charles and Lady Diana on their visit to open Expo 86. His retirement being announced, a Social Credit convention was scheduled for the Whistler Resort, which came down to a three-way shooting match between Bud Smith, the Premier's right-hand man but an unelected official, Social Credit party grande dame Grace McCarthy, and the charismatic but eccentric Bill Vander Zalm.

                            Bill Vander Zalm became the new Social Credit leader when Smith threw his support to him rather than see McCarthy win, and led the party to victory in the election later that year. Vander Zalm was later involved in a conflict of interest scandal following the sale of Fantasy Gardens, a Christian and Dutch culture theme park built by the Premier, to Tan Yu, a Filipino Chinese gambling kingpin. There were also concerns over Yu's application to the government for a bank licence, and lurid stories from flamboyant realtor Faye Leung of a party in the "Howard Hughes Suite" on the top two floors of the Bayshore Inn, where Tan Yu had been staying, with reports of a bag of money in a brown paper bag passed from Yu to Vander Zalm during the goings-on. These scandals forced Vander Zalm's resignation, and Rita Johnston became premier of the province. Johnston presided over the end of Social Credit power, calling an election which reduced the party's caucus to only two seats, and the revival of the long-defunct British Columbia Liberal Party as Opposition to the victorious NDP under former Vancouver mayor Mike Harcourt.

                            In 1988, David Lam was appointed as British Columbia's twenty-fifth lieutenant governor, and was the province's first lieutenant governor of Chinese origin.

                                Johnston lost the 1991 general election to the NDP, under the leadership of Mike Harcourt, a former mayor of Vancouver. The NDP's unprecedented creation of new parkland and protected areas was popular and helped boost the province's growing tourism sector, although the economy continued to struggle against the backdrop of a weak resource economy. Housing starts and an expanded service sector saw growth overall through the decade, despite political turmoil. Harcourt ended up resigning over "Bingogate"—a political scandal involving the funnelling of charity bingo receipts into party coffers in certain ridings. Harcourt was not implicated, but he resigned nonetheless in respect of constitutional conventions calling for leaders under suspicion to step aside. Glen Clark, a former president of the BC Federation of Labour, was chosen the new leader of the NDP, which won a second term in 1996. More scandals dogged the party, most notably the fast ferry scandal involving the province trying to develop the shipbuilding industry in British Columbia. An allegation (never substantiated) that the premier had received a favour in return for granting a gaming licence led to Clark's resignation as premier. He was succeeded on an interim basis by Dan Miller who was in turn followed by Ujjal Dosanjh following a leadership convention.

                                In the 2001 provincial election, Gordon Campbell's Liberals defeated the NDP, gaining 77 out of 79 total seats in the provincial legislature. Campbell instituted various reforms and removed some of the NDP's policies including scrapping the "fast ferries" project, lowering income taxes, and the controversial sale of BC Rail to Canadian National Railway. Campbell was also the subject of criticism after he was arrested for driving under the influence during a vacation in Hawaii, but he still managed to lead his party to victory in the 2005 provincial election against a substantially strengthened NDP opposition. Campbell won a third term in the 2009 provincial election, marking the first time in 23 years a premier has been elected to a third term.
                                
                                The province won a bid to host the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and Whistler. As promised in his 2002 re-election campaign, Vancouver Mayor Larry Campbell staged a non-binding civic referendum regarding the hosting of the Olympics. In February 2003, Vancouver's residents voted in a referendum accepting the responsibilities of the host city should it win its bid. Sixty-four percent of residents voted in favour of hosting the games.<sup>[73]</sup>

                                After the Olympic joy had faded, Campbell's popularity started to fall. His management style, the implementation of the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) against election promises and the cancelling of the BC Rail corruption trial led to low approval ratings and loss of caucus support. He resigned in November 2010 and called on the party to elect a new leader.[74]

                                In early 2011, former deputy premier Christy Clark became leader of the Liberal Party. Though she was not a sitting MLA, she went on to win the seat left vacant by Campbell. For the next two years, she attempted to distance herself from the unpopularity of Campbell and forge an image for the upcoming 2013 election. Among her early accomplishments were raising the minimum wage, creating a new statutory holiday in February called "Family Day", and pushing the development of BC's liquefied natural gas industry. In the lead-up to the 2013 election, the Liberals lagged behind the NDP by a double-digit gap in the polls, but were able to achieve a surprise victory on election night, winning a majority and making Clark the first woman to lead a party to victory in a general election in BC.<sup>[75]</sup> While Clark lost her seat to NDP candidate David Eby, she later won a by-election in the riding of Westside-Kelowna. Her government went on to balance the budget, implement changes to liquor laws and continue with the question of the proposed Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines.
                                
                                In the 2017 election, the NDP formed a minority government with the support of the Green Party through a confidence and supply agreement. The NDP and Green caucuses together controlled 44 seats, compared to the Liberals' 43. On July 18, 2017, NDP leader John Horgan was sworn in as the premier of British Columbia. He was the province's first NDP premier in 16 years. Clark resigned shortly thereafter, and Andrew Wilkinson was voted to become leader of the BC Liberals. In late 2020, Horgan called an early election. In the 2020 British Columbia general election, the NDP won 57 seats and formed a majority government, making Horgan the first NDP premier to be re-elected in the province. Wilkinson resigned as the leader of the BC Liberals two days later.
                                
                                British Columbia was significantly affected by demographic changes within Canada and around the world. Vancouver (and to a lesser extent some other parts of British Columbia) was a major destination for many of the immigrants from Hong Kong who left the former UK colony (either temporarily or permanently) in the years immediately prior to its handover to China. British Columbia has also been a significant destination for internal Canadian migrants. This has been the case throughout recent decades,[when?] because of its natural environment, mild climate and relaxed lifestyle, but has been particularly true during periods of economic growth.[citation needed] British Columbia has moved from approximately 10 percent of Canada's population in 1971 to approximately 13 percent in 2006. Trends of urbanization mean the Greater Vancouver area now includes 51 percent of the province's population, followed by Greater Victoria with 8 percent. These two metropolitan regions have traditionally dominated the demographics of BC.
                                
                                By 2018, housing prices in Vancouver were the second-least affordable in the world, behind only Hong Kong.<sup>[76]</sup> Many experts point to evidence of money-laundering from mainland China as a contributing factor. The high price of residential real estate has led to the implementation of an empty homes tax, a housing speculation and vacancy tax, and a foreign buyers' tax on housing.<sup>[77]</sup>
                                
                                The net number of people coming to BC from other provinces in 2016 was almost four times larger than in 2012. BC was the largest net recipient of interprovincial migrants in Canada in the first quarter of 2016 with half of the 5,000 people coming from Alberta.<sup>[78]</sup>
                                
                                By 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic had had a major effect on the province,<sup>[79]</sup> with over 2,000 deaths and 250,000 confirmed cases. However, the COVID-19 vaccine reduced the spread of the virus, with 78 percent of people in BC over the age of five having been fully vaccinated.
                                
                                In 2021, the unmarked gravesites of hundreds of Indigenous children were discovered at three former Indian residential schools (Kamloops, St. Eugene's Mission, Kuper Island).<sup>[80][81]</sup></p>

                                <p id="25">
                                    BC's economy is diverse, with service-producing industries accounting for the largest portion of the province's GDP.[96] It is the terminus of two transcontinental railways, and the site of 27 major marine cargo and passenger terminals. Though less than 5 percent of its vast 944,735 square kilometres (364,764 sq mi) land is arable, the province is agriculturally rich (particularly in the Fraser and Okanagan valleys), because of milder weather near the coast and in certain sheltered southern valleys. Its climate encourages outdoor recreation and tourism, though its economic mainstay has long been resource extraction, principally logging, farming, and mining. Vancouver, the province's largest city, serves as the headquarters of many western-based natural resource companies. It also benefits from a strong housing market and a per capita income well above the national average. While the coast of British Columbia and some valleys in the south-central part of the province have mild weather, the majority of its land mass experiences a cold-winter-temperate climate similar to the rest of Canada. The Northern Interior region has a subarctic climate with very cold winters. The climate of Vancouver is by far the mildest winter climate of the major Canadian cities, with nighttime January temperatures averaging above the freezing point.<sup>[97]</sup>

                                    British Columbia has a history of being a resource dominated economy, centred on the forestry industry but also with fluctuating importance in mining. Employment in the resource sector has fallen steadily as a percentage of employment, and new jobs are mostly in the construction and retail/service sectors. It now has the highest percentage of service industry jobs in the west, comprising 72 percent of industry (compared to 60 percent Western Canadian average).<sup>[98]</sup> The largest section of this employment is in finance, insurance, real estate and corporate management; however, many areas outside of metropolitan areas are still heavily reliant on resource extraction. With its film industry known as Hollywood North, the Vancouver region is the third-largest feature film production location in North America, after Los Angeles and New York City.<sup>[99]</sup>
                                    
                                    The economic history of British Columbia is replete with tales of dramatic upswings and downswings, and this boom and bust pattern has influenced the politics, culture and business climate of the province. Economic activity related to mining in particular has widely fluctuated with changes in commodity prices over time, with documented costs to community health.<sup>[100]</sup>

In 2017, British Columbia's real GDP growth of 3.9 percent ranked second among Canadian provinces.<sup>[105]</sup>

                                    British Columbia has an 87-member elected Legislative Assembly, elected by the plurality voting system, though from 2003 to 2009 there was significant debate about switching to a single transferable vote system called BC-STV. The government of the day appoints ministers for various portfolios, what are officially part of the Executive Council, of whom the premier is chair.
                                    
                                    The province is currently governed by the <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia_New_Democratic_Party" title="British Columbia New Democratic Party">British Columbia New Democratic Party</a> (BC NDP) under Premier <a href="/wiki/John_Horgan" title="John Horgan">John Horgan</a>. The 2017 provincial election saw the Liberal Party take 43 seats, the NDP take 41, and the <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia_Green_Party" class="mw-redirect" title="British Columbia Green Party">British Columbia Green Party</a> take 3. No party met the minimum of 44 seats for a majority, therefore leading to the first minority government since 1953. Following the election, the Greens entered into negotiations with both the Liberals and NDP, eventually announcing they would support the current NDP minority. Previously, the right-of-centre <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia_Liberal_Party" title="British Columbia Liberal Party">British Columbia Liberal Party</a> governed the province for 16 years between 2001 and 2017, and won the largest landslide election in British Columbia history in 2001, with 77 of 79 seats. The legislature became more evenly divided between the Liberals and NDP following the 2005 (46 Liberal seats of 79) and 2009 (49 Liberal seats of 85) provincial elections. The NDP and its predecessor the <a href="/wiki/Co-operative_Commonwealth_Federation" title="Co-operative Commonwealth Federation">Co-operative Commonwealth Federation</a> (CCF) have been the main opposition force to right-wing parties since the 1930s and have ruled with majority governments in 1972–1975 and 1991–2001. The Green Party plays a larger role in the politics of British Columbia than Green parties do in most other jurisdictions in Canada. After a breakthrough election in 2001 (12.39 percent), the party's vote share declined (2005 – 9.17 percent, 2009 – 8.09 percent, 2013 – 8.13 percent) before increasing again to a record high of 16.84 percent at the 2017 election.

                                    The British Columbia Liberal Party is not related to the federal Liberal Party and does not share the same ideology. Instead, the BC Liberal party is a rather diverse coalition, made up of the remnants of the Social Credit Party, many federal Liberals, federal Conservatives, and those who would otherwise support right-of-centre or free enterprise parties. Historically, there have commonly been third parties present in the legislature (including the Liberals themselves from 1952 to 1975); the BC Green Party are the current third party in British Columbia, with three seats in the legislature.

                                    Prior to the rise of the Liberal Party, British Columbia's main political party was the British Columbia Social Credit Party which ruled British Columbia for 20 continuous years. While sharing some ideology with the current Liberal government, they were more right-wing although undertook nationalization of various important monopolies, notably BC Hydro and BC Ferries.

                                    British Columbia is known for having politically active labour unions who have traditionally supported the NDP or its predecessor, the CCF.

                                    British Columbia's political history is typified by scandal and a cast of colourful characters, beginning with various colonial-era land scandals and abuses of power by early officials (such as those that led to <a href="/wiki/McGowan%27s_War" title="McGowan's War">McGowan's War</a> in 1858–59). Notable scandals in Social Credit years included the <a href="/wiki/Robert_Bonner_(politician)" title="Robert Bonner (politician)">Robert Bonner</a> Affair and the <a href="/wiki/Fantasy_Gardens" title="Fantasy Gardens">Fantasy Gardens</a> scandal which forced Premier Bill Vander Zalm to resign and ended the Social Credit era. NDP scandals included Bingogate, which brought down NDP Premier Mike Harcourt, and the alleged scandal named Casinogate which drove NDP Premier Glen Clark to resign. A variety of scandals plagued the 2001–2017 Liberal government, including Premier Gordon Campbell's arrest for drunk driving in Maui and the resignation of various cabinet ministers because of conflict-of-interest allegations. A <a href="/wiki/BC_Legislature_Raids" title="BC Legislature Raids">raid on the Parliament Buildings</a> on December 28, 2003,<sup id="cite_ref-107" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-107">[106]</a></sup> in Victoria, including the Premier's Office, resulted in charges only for ministerial aides, although key cabinet members from the time have since resigned. The case, currently in preliminary hearings in the courts and relating to the sale of BC Rail to CN Rail, may not reach trial because of the mass of evidence and various procedural problems.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

                                    <p id="27">Transportation played a huge role in British Columbia's history. The Rocky Mountains and the ranges west of them constituted a significant obstacle to overland travel until the completion of the transcontinental railway in 1885. The Peace River Canyon through the Rocky Mountains was the route the earliest explorers and fur traders used. Fur trade routes were only marginally used for access to British Columbia through the mountains. Travel from the rest of Canada before 1885 meant the difficulty of overland travel via the United States, around Cape Horn or overseas from Asia. Nearly all travel and freight to and from the region occurred via the Pacific Ocean, primarily through the ports of Victoria and New Westminster.

                                        Until the 1930s, rail was the only means of overland travel to and from the rest of Canada; travellers using motor vehicles needed to journey through the United States. With the construction of the Inter-Provincial Highway in 1932 (now known as the Crowsnest Pass Highway), and later the Trans-Canada Highway, road transportation evolved into the preferred mode of overland travel to and from the rest of the country.

                                Because of its size and rugged, varying topography, British Columbia requires thousands of kilometres of provincial highways to connect its communities. British Columbia's roads systems were notoriously poorly maintained and dangerous until a concentrated programme of improvement was initiated in the 1950s and 1960s. There are now <a href="/wiki/Controlled-access_highway" title="Controlled-access highway">freeways</a> in Greater Victoria, the Lower Mainland, and Central Interior of the province. Much of the rest of the province, where traffic volumes are generally low, is accessible by well-maintained generally high-mobility two-lane <a href="/wiki/Arterial_road" title="Arterial road">arterial highways</a> with additional passing lanes in mountainous areas and usually only a few stop-controlled intersections outside the main urban areas.

                                    Prior to 1979, surface <a href="/wiki/Public_transport" title="Public transport">public transit</a> in the Vancouver and Victoria metropolitan areas was administered by BC Hydro, the provincially owned electricity utility. Subsequently, the province established <a href="/wiki/BC_Transit" title="BC Transit">BC Transit</a> to oversee and operate all municipal transportation systems. In 1998, the Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority, now <a href="/wiki/TransLink_(British_Columbia)" title="TransLink (British Columbia)">TransLink</a>, a separate authority for routes within the Greater Vancouver Regional District, was established. Some smaller island communities, such as <a href="/wiki/Gabriola_Island" title="Gabriola Island">Gabriola Island</a><sup id="cite_ref-112" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-112">[111]</a></sup> and, formerly, <a href="/wiki/Pender_Island" title="Pender Island">Pender Island</a><sup id="cite_ref-113" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-113">[112]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-114" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-114">[113]</a></sup> operate routes independent of BC Transit or TransLink. BC Transit has recently expanded to provide intercity routes,<sup id="cite_ref-115" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-115">[114]</a></sup> particularly in the Northern region of British Columbia. Other intercity routes were introduced connecting southern communities in preparation of the cancellation of <a href="/wiki/Greyhound_Canada" title="Greyhound Canada">Greyhound Canada</a>'s pullout from Western Canada,<sup id="cite_ref-116" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-116">[115]</a></sup> though options for intercity bus travel are still extremely limited.

                                    Public transit in British Columbia consists mainly of diesel buses, although Vancouver is also serviced by a fleet of trolleybuses. Several experimental buses are being tested such as hybrid buses that have both gasoline and electric engines. Additionally, there are CNG-fuelled buses being tested and used in Nanaimo and Kamloops systems.<sup>[116]</sup> British Columbia also tested a fleet of Hydrogen-fuelled buses for the Vancouver-Whistler Winter Olympics in 2010.<sup>[117]</sup> TransLink operates SkyTrain, an automated metro system serving the cities of Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, Surrey, Richmond, Coquitlam, and Port Moody. In 2009, the Canada Line SkyTrain was completed, linking Vancouver International Airport and the city of Richmond to downtown Vancouver bringing the total to three operating metro lines.

                                    A new extension to Coquitlam and <a href="/wiki/Port_Moody" title="Port Moody">Port Moody</a> (the <a href="/wiki/Evergreen_Extension" title="Evergreen Extension">Evergreen Extension</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Line" title="Millennium Line">Millennium Line</a>) was completed in December 2016. There is planning for an extension of the Millennium Line through Vancouver City to the <a href="/wiki/University_of_British_Columbia" title="University of British Columbia">University of British Columbia</a>. Turnstiles have been added to all existing stations in the system. In the past, SkyTrain used a proof of payment honour system. In the capital city of Victoria BC Transit and the provincial government's infrastructure ministry are working together to create a bus rapid transit from the Westshore communities to downtown Victoria.<sup id="cite_ref-119" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-119">[118]</a></sup> In <a href="/wiki/Kamloops" title="Kamloops">Kamloops</a>, there is a bus rapid transit GPS trial underway to see how bus rapid transit affects smaller cities, rather than larger ones, like Victoria and Vancouver.<sup id="cite_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-120">[119]</a></sup>

                                    Rail development expanded greatly in the decades after the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Pacific_Railway" title="Canadian Pacific Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> was completed, in 1885, and was the chief mode of long-distance surface transportation until the expansion and improvement of the provincial highways system began in the 1950s. Two major routes through the <a href="/wiki/Yellowhead_Pass" title="Yellowhead Pass">Yellowhead Pass</a> competed with the Canadian Pacific Railway – the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Trunk_Pacific" class="mw-redirect" title="Grand Trunk Pacific">Grand Trunk Pacific</a>, terminating at Prince Rupert, and the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Northern_Railway" title="Canadian Northern Railway">Canadian Northern Railway</a>, terminating at Vancouver.
                                    
                                    The British Columbia Electric Railway provided rail services in Victoria and Vancouver between the nineteenth century and mid twentieth century.

                                    The <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Great_Eastern" class="mw-redirect" title="Pacific Great Eastern">Pacific Great Eastern</a> line supplemented this service, providing a north–south route between interior resource communities and the coast. The Pacific Great Eastern (later known as British Columbia Railway and now owned by Canadian National Railway) connects Fort St James, Fort Nelson, and <a href="/wiki/Tumbler_Ridge,_British_Columbia" class="mw-redirect" title="Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia">Tumbler Ridge</a> with <a href="/wiki/North_Vancouver_(city)" title="North Vancouver (city)">North Vancouver</a>. The E&amp;N Railway, rebranded as <a href="/wiki/Southern_Railway_of_Vancouver_Island" title="Southern Railway of Vancouver Island">Southern Railway of Vancouver Island</a>, formerly served the commercial and passenger train markets of Vancouver Island. Service along the route is now minimal. Vancouver Island was also host to the <a href="/wiki/Englewood_Railway" title="Englewood Railway">last logging railway in North America</a> until its closure in 2017.

                                    Current passenger services in British Columbia are limited. <a href="/wiki/Via_Rail_Canada" class="mw-redirect" title="Via Rail Canada">Via Rail Canada</a> operates six long-distance trains on two lines.<sup id="cite_ref-121" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-121">[120]</a></sup> Local services are limited to two regions, with <a href="/wiki/TransLink_(British_Columbia)" title="TransLink (British Columbia)">TransLink</a> providing rapid transit and commuter services in the <a href="/wiki/Lower_Mainland" title="Lower Mainland">Lower Mainland</a> and by the <a href="/wiki/Seton_Lake_Indian_Band" class="mw-redirect" title="Seton Lake Indian Band">Seton Lake Indian Band</a> South of <a href="/wiki/Lillooet" title="Lillooet">Lillooet</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Kaoham_Shuttle" title="Kaoham Shuttle">Kaoham Shuttle</a>. <a href="/wiki/Amtrak" title="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> runs international passenger service between Vancouver, <a href="/wiki/Seattle" title="Seattle">Seattle</a>, and intermediate points.<sup id="cite_ref-122" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-122">[121]</a></sup>
                                    
                                    Several heritage railways operate within the province, including the White Pass & Yukon Route that runs between Alaska and the Yukon via British Columbia.

                                    BC Ferries was established as a provincial crown corporation in 1960 to provide passenger and vehicle ferry service between Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland as a cheaper and more reliable alternative to the service operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway and other private operators. It now operates 25 routes among the islands of British Columbia, as well as between the islands and the mainland. Ferry service to Washington is offered by the Washington State Ferries (between Sidney and Anacortes) and Black Ball Transport (between Victoria and Port Angeles, Washington). Ferry service over inland lakes and rivers is provided by the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Various other coastal ferries are operated privately.
                                    
                                    Commercial ocean transport is of vital importance.

                                        Vancouver, Victoria, and Prince Rupert are also major ports of call for cruise ships. In 2007, a large maritime container port was opened in Prince Rupert with an inland sorting port in Prince George.
